## About me
Rohit Kanrar is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), where he is fortunate to be co-advised by Professor [Dan Nettleton](https://dnett.github.io/). Earlier chapters of Rohit's doctoral dissertation were co-advised by Professor [Zhanrui Cai](https://zhanruicai.github.io/) and Professor [Chunlin Li](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/people/chunlin-li), and Rohit is grateful for their support and guidance. Statistics is Rohit's passion and he truly enjoys learning new concepts in statistics. 

Outside of research, Rohit loves to cook, follows sports, listen to music and make new friends outside of workplace. He is a lifelong supporter of [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/). The history of Man United has taught him important life lessons. He has no plans to stop supporting Man United, even if they are relegated from the Premier League to the Championship.
