## Overall Theme of Rohit's Research
Rohit's research currently centers on **sequential decision-making in high-stakes environments,** where statistical (online) inference is critical, and **valid uncertainty quantification (UQ)** protects automated decision-makers from committing potentially costly errors. The overarching goal of his research is to develop **efficient, robust and transparent** artificial intelligent (AI) systems, capable of making well-reasoned decisions with valid UQ.


## Research Interests
* **Theory and Methods**: Online Learning and Inference, Causal Inference, Preference Learning, Predictive Inference
* **Application Areas**: Health Communication, Public Health, Clinical Trial, Sports, Genetics
